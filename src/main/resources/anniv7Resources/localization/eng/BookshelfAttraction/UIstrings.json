      "An aggressive and vicious species, #yJaw #yWorms are found mostly near the base of the Spire. NL They are seemingly capable of teamwork - some packs of them have climbed even above the #yCity - but it's also not uncommon to see them fighting amongst themselves when agitated. NL NL Their biology is curious, having only two limbs in total, and no obvious sensory organs to speak of aside from their oversized maws. Upon closer inspection, they do appear to have #pvestigial #peyes, and I suspect that some of the protrusions on their back are really supposed to be legs.

NL #yRed #yLice are more aggressive, charging straight into battle against any percieved threat (including harmless researchers!!!), whereas #yGreen #yLice are far more cautious. NL The green variety are able to produce a #psticky #pweb-like #psubstance, which they spit at enemies to immobilise them. NL In addition, both kinds of Lice demonstrate a behaviour known as #b\"curling #bup\" when they sense danger, which protects their soft underbelly from further attack. NL NL #yLice can be placated by giving them food - they're carnivorous, so any kind of #rmeat does the trick - and they can even become quite affectionate if consistently fed and cared for! NL Beware of feeding #yRed #yLice too much, though, as they're capable of growing to more than #pdouble their original size..."
