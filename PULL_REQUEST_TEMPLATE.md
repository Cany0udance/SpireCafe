### Description
The Powerelic Professor will allow you to turn one(?) Power card into a Relic. You may notice that during the process, some of your Relics will randomly become Power cards. That's a perfectly ordinary side-effect, nothing to worry about.     
<b>This is a preliminary playtest build to determine if the costs and rewards are appropriate.</b>
